Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance In A Multi-Robot System

Undergrad Thesis Project:
Dynamic obstacle avoidance in a multi-robot system is a system consisting of two robots in a virtual grid-like structure. These robots are completely autonomous and alter their paths solely based on interactive communication through a wireless protocol.

The application of this robot is for an indoor environment where GPS tracking is difficult hence, we made use of optical encoders to calculate the position of the robot. Our aim was to create a virtual map that enables the robots to move in an optimal path.

Hardware: ESP32, MPU6050 (6 DOF IMU), pulse encoder
Software: Arduino IDE, MQTT Fx
